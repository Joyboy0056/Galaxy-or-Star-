# Galaxy-or-Star-
This is my first ML project based on neural networks and deep learning. Starting from actual-pictures of stars and galaxies took from a real telescope in India, I tried to implement a CNN model for their classification

The project wants to provide a CNN-Powered Classification of Celestial Images by developeing convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify astronomical objects, specifically stars and galaxies, using real observational data (see the link in the description for the Kaggle dataset). The model was trained on a large dataset of labeled images, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between different celestial bodies. The project involved data preprocessing, model optimization, and validation using advanced techniques in deep learning, demonstrating the potential of AI in astronomical research and image analysis.
